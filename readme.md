Hello! :smile: :wave:

I'm Marco :shipit:, I was intern from March to October at ICube's Laboratory. I sum up in this Github repository all the code that could be useful for any reason to my team or to new interns of my team. I cared to put everything in a way that is as clear and straightforward to use as possible[^1].

Here is what I leave:

- **Perlin noise dataset**: code to generate a toy dataset via Perlin Noise.

- **UNet**: code for UNet

- **functions**: generic utilities functions (you can code them easily yourself tbh!)

[^1]: a lot of times this isn't gonna be the case, just to warn you.
