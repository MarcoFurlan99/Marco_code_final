Hello! :smile: :wave:

I'm Marco :shipit:, I was intern from March to October at ICube's Laboratory. I sum up in this Github repository all the code that could be useful for any reason to my team or to new interns of my team. I cared to put everything in a way that is as clear and straightforward to use as possible.

Contents:

- **Dataset_generators**: code to generate toy datasets.

- **Functions**: generic utilities functions.

- **UNet**: UNet code.

- ***example.ipynb***: notebook with example of use of all codes.

- ***main.py***: ignore for the moment.

In the folders README.md files with details.
